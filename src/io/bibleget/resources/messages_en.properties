If\ the\ query\ following\ the\ semi-colon\ refers\ to\ the\ same\ book\ as\ the\ preceding\ query,\ it\ is\ not\ necessary\ to\ indicate\ the\ book\ a\ second\ time. = If the query following the semi-colon refers to the same book as the preceding query, it is not necessary to indicate the book a second time.
